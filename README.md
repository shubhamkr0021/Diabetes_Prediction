# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic data such as glucose levels, BMI, and age.  
It applies **Machine Learning algorithms** — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVC — to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.  
The project includes a **Flask web app** that allows users to input medical data and receive real-time predictions.
